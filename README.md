# @skyux-sdk/angular-builders

## Installation

Within the directory of an Angular CLI application, run:

```
ng add @skyux-sdk/angular-builders
```

## Usage

### Upgrading SKY UX package dependencies

This builder automatically upgrades all Angular and SKY UX packages to their latest supported versions.

- `ng run my-project:skyux-upgrade-dependencies`
- Add `--dry-run` to see the updates but leave your `package.json` file unaffected.

## Local setup

- Run `npm start` for local development; changes are transpiled automatically after each file is saved.
- Run `npm run build` to create the distribution package.
